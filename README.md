# EDA-on-StackOverflow-survey-2020--Data-Analysis-with-Python
I have performed a complete exploratory data analysis on the survey responses from Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020.

Through my exploratory data analysis on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 dataset, I came across the following conclusions:

1. The highest number of respondents were from the USA and India. And almost 63% of the participants in the survey were from countries that use English as a spoken language or prioritize it professionally. So, based on the respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community, but it has comparatively fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries.

2. Most of the respondents fall between the age group 20–40, with the majority between the ages 25–30. Thus, most of the youths are into programming.

3. Only about 8% of survey respondents who have answered the question identify as women or non-binary and about 92% are men. So it can be concluded that there is a huge difference between the number of men and the number of women & non-binary genders in the programming field.

4. About 50% of the respondents hold a bachelor's or master's degree, but about 40% of those programmers holding a college degree have a field of study other than computer science. So, while a formal education is important in general, it is not mandatory for someone to pursue a degree in the field of computer science to become a programmer or make a career out of it.

5. More than 70% of the respondents are employed full-time. Around 10% work as an independent contractor, freelancer, or are self-employed.

6. Most of the women work as full-stack developers or backend developers.

7. Javascript & HTML/CSS were the most popular programming languages in 2020. This was followed by SQL and Python.

8. The most popular language among students was HTML/CSS, whereas JavaScript was the most popular among Professionals. Moreover, JavaScript was the most preferred programming language among numerous groups.

9. Python was the most used language among data scientists, followed by SQL.

10. Rust and TypeScript were the most loved programming language in 2020, followed by Python, whereas VBA and Objective-C were the most dreaded ones, followed by Perl.

11. Most of the respondents were interested in learning Python over the next year.

12. The average working hours for programmers was around 41 hours per week. North America was the continent with the highest working hours followed by Asia.

13. Most of the respondents started programming before the age of 40, although people of all age groups were involved in coding. We can conclude that a person can learn to code at any age.
